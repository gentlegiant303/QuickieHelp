- *Group project for University of Denver coding bootcamp.
- Collaborators: Daniel Hernandez, Becky Armstrong, Ben Petrila, Marcus Ornelas.

# First Draft # 

# QuickieHelp is a community platform for charities and people to connect. Charities will be able to post when they need volunteers or help in some kind of physical capacity. Users will then be able to see a list of available opportunities to connect with other members of the community and the charity itself. 

# We are structured to push the community aspect first and foremost. The idea stems from the social aspect and connections people make while volunteering. Many people in Denver CO volunteer for charities as a way of connecting with other like-minded or new locals to the community.This platform will make it easier to connect and give charities an opportunity to reach the community without mass email spam. 

# QuickieHelp will have featured charities, users, as well as other incentives for people to be active within both the local community, and the quickieHelp community. 

# Charities will have an option to pay a fee for priority placement on website.
